# RetroDRY-ClientTemplate

This template is a starting point for a React/RetroDRY client app. It is based on create-react-app, so you can start with directions from here: https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app

This template has been updated to work with RetryDRY 1.4.1.

You will need to go through and search for "TODO" instances in the code base to compelete the app.

The main RetroDRY documentation is hosted at https://github.com/starlys/RetroDRY#readme
