# RetroDRY-ClientTemplate

This template is a starting point for a React/RetroDRY client app. It is based on create-react-app, so you can start with directions from here: https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app

You will need to go through and search for "TODO" instances in the code base to compelete the app.

The main RetroDRY documentation is hosted at https://github.com/starlys/RetroDRY#readme
